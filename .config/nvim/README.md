LazyVim is a Neovim setup powered by [ðŸ’¤ lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
to make it easy to customize and extend your config.
Rather than having to choose between starting from scratch or using a
pre-made distro, LazyVim offers the best of both worlds - the flexibility
to tweak your config as needed, along with the convenience of a pre-configured setup.
