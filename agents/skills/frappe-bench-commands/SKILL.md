# Bench Commands

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for using the Frappe bench command-line interface in development environments, covering all aspects from site creation to production backup restoration.

## Environment Constants

When working with bench commands, use these standard development environment values:

- **Site Name**: `development.localhost`
- **Database Root Password**: `123`
- **Admin Password**: `admin`
- **Bench Path**: `/workspace/development/frappe-bench`

All commands assume execution from the bench directory unless otherwise specified.

## Command Categories

Commands are organized by functional area. See the corresponding reference file for detailed information:

### Site Management

- And many more specialized commands

## Common Workflows

For complete step-by-step workflows, see [references/workflows.md](references/workflows.md):
- **Fresh Install**: Complete setup from scratch
- **Restore from Production**: Migrating production backups to development
- **Quick Reinstall**: Reinstalling apps without dropping the site
- **Large Database Restore**: Configuring MariaDB for large backups

## Usage

When a user asks about bench commands or needs help with Frappe development operations:

1. **Identify the category** of their request (site management, backup, database, etc.)
2. **Reference the appropriate section** from references/ directory
3. **Provide the specific commands** with the correct environment constants
4. **Include important notes** about prerequisites or side effects

Always ensure commands use the correct site name (`development.localhost`) and include necessary flags like `--db-root-password` when required.

## Key Principles

- **Always specify site name**: Most commands require `--site development.localhost`
- **Database root access**: Use `--db-root-password 123` for operations requiring database root access
- **Developer mode**: Enable for development work with `bench --site development.localhost set-config developer_mode 1`
- **Cache clearing**: After code or configuration changes, run `bench clear-cache`
- **Migration after changes**: Run `bench --site development.localhost migrate` after app installations or updates

## Important Notes

- Backups are automatically created in `./sites/development.localhost/private/backups/` unless specified otherwise
- Runtime MariaDB settings (memory limits) are lost on container restart - add to docker-compose.yml to persist
- When recreating a site, always set the encryption_key from backup before restoring data
- Use `--skip-search-index` flag with migrate for faster migrations during development
