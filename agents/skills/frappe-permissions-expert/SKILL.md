# Frappe Permissions Expert

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for understanding and extending Frappe's permission system.

## Overview

Frappe's permission system is multi-layered and evaluates permissions in a specific order:

1. **Administrator Check**: Administrator user bypasses all permission checks
2. **Role-Based Permissions**: DocType permissions configured through Permission Manager
3. **Controller Permissions**: Custom `has_permission` hooks in doctypes
4. **User Permissions**: Document-level restrictions based on user-specific rules
5. **Permission Query Conditions**: SQL-based filters for list views and reports
6. **Share Permissions**: Explicit document sharing between users

## Permission Types

Frappe supports the following permission types (ptypes):

```python
rights = (
    "select",    # View in list (limited fields)
    "read",      # Full read access
    "write",     # Edit existing documents
    "create",    # Create new documents
    "delete",    # Delete documents
    "submit",    # Submit submittable documents
    "cancel",    # Cancel submitted documents
    "amend",     # Amend cancelled documents
    "print",     # Print documents
    "email",     # Email documents
    "report",    # Access reports
    "import",    # Import documents
    "export",    # Export documents
    "share",     # Share documents with others
)
```

## Quick Reference

### Main Permission Check Function

```python
frappe.has_permission(
    doctype="DocType Name",
    ptype="read",              # Permission type to check
    doc=None,                  # Optional: specific document instance
    user=None,                 # Optional: defaults to current user
    raise_exception=True,      # Display error message if False
    parent_doctype=None,       # Required for child doctypes
    debug=False,               # Enable debug logging
    ignore_share_permissions=False
)
```

### Key Concepts

- **Child Tables**: Don't have their own permissions; permissions are checked on the parent document
- **Virtual DocTypes**: Permission query conditions don't apply; only `has_permission` hook and role permissions apply
- **Permission Levels**: Provide field-level access control within a document (permlevel 0, 1, 2, etc.)

## Extension Hooks

Frappe provides seven main hooks for extending permission logic:

### 1. `has_permission` - Controller Permission Check

**Purpose**: Implement custom document-level permission logic

**Location**: In your doctype's `.py` file or registered in `hooks.py`

**Signature**:
```python
def has_permission(doc, ptype=None, user=None, debug=False):
    """
    Returns:
        bool or None:
            - True: Explicitly grant permission
            - False: Explicitly deny permission
            - None: No opinion, continue with other checks
    """
```

**Important Notes**:
- Return `None` to defer to other permission checks (recommended default)
- Return `False` to explicitly deny permission (overrides role permissions)
- Return `True` to explicitly grant permission (use with caution)

**When to read:** See [references/has-permission-hook.md](references/has-permission-hook.md) when implementing document-level permission logic with 7 detailed examples covering owner access, team hierarchies, status restrictions, and more.

### 2. `permission_query_conditions` - List View Filtering and Document Access

**Purpose**: Return SQL WHERE conditions to filter documents in list views and validate individual document access

**Location**: In your doctype's `.py` file or registered in `hooks.py`

**Signature**:
```python
def get_permission_query_conditions(user=None, doctype=None):
    """
    Returns:
        str: SQL WHERE clause without the "WHERE" keyword
             Returns empty string "" to allow all documents
    """
```

**Security**: Always escape dynamic values with `frappe.db.escape()`

**Important**: These conditions are checked both in list views AND when accessing individual documents via `has_permission()` for read/select operations.

**When to read:** See [references/permission-query-conditions-hook.md](references/permission-query-conditions-hook.md) when implementing list filtering or document access validation with 7 examples including company filtering, role-based regions, time-based access, and multi-tenant patterns.

### 3. `write_permission_query_conditions` - Post-Write Validation

**Purpose**: Validate that saved/updated documents satisfy custom conditions before committing to database

**Location**: In your doctype's `.py` file or registered in `hooks.py`

**Signature**:
```python
def get_write_permission_query_conditions(user=None, doctype=None, permtype="write"):
    """
    Checked AFTER database write but BEFORE commit.
    If validation fails, transaction is rolled back.
    """
```

**When to read:** See [references/write-permission-query-conditions-hook.md](references/write-permission-query-conditions-hook.md) when validating writes before commit with examples for regional restrictions, document age limits, and status-based validation.

### 4. Server Scripts - Permission Query

**Purpose**: Define permission query conditions using Server Scripts (Python code in the UI)

**Location**: Created through Frappe UI at `/app/server-script`

**Script Type**: "Permission Query"

**When to read:** See [references/server-scripts.md](references/server-scripts.md) when prototyping permission logic via UI before moving to code, with examples for department filtering and role-based access.

### 5. `has_website_permission` - Website/Portal Access

**Purpose**: Control access to documents on the website/portal (not desk)

**Location**: In your doctype's `.py` file or registered in `hooks.py`

**When to read:** See [references/has-website-permission-hook.md](references/has-website-permission-hook.md) when implementing portal/website access control with examples for customer orders, published content, and contact relationships.

## Workflow Permission Hooks

Frappe provides two additional hooks specifically for workflow-based permissions:

### 6. `filter_workflow_transitions` - Custom Transition Filtering

**Purpose**: Filter and customize the list of available workflow transitions based on custom logic

**Location**: Registered in `hooks.py`

**Use Cases**:
- Hide specific transitions based on document field values
- Apply time-based or date-based restrictions
- Implement dynamic transition visibility

### 7. `has_workflow_action_permission` - Action-Level Permission

**Purpose**: Control which users should receive workflow action notifications and have permission to execute specific actions

**Location**: Registered in `hooks.py`

**Use Cases**:
- Implement approval hierarchies
- Department or region-based approval routing
- Amount-based approval limits

**When to read:** See [references/workflow-permission-hooks.md](references/workflow-permission-hooks.md) when implementing workflow transition filtering or approval routing with 10+ examples covering hierarchical approvals, time restrictions, and regional routing.

## User Permissions

User Permissions restrict access to specific document values for link fields.

**Creating User Permissions**:
```python
from frappe.permissions import add_user_permission

add_user_permission(
    doctype="Company",
    name="Company A",
    user="user@example.com",
    applicable_for="Sales Order",  # Optional
    is_default=1,                  # Optional
    ignore_permissions=True        # Optional
)
```

**Use Cases**:
- Restrict sales users to their own territory
- Limit employees to their branch/department
- Multi-company access control

**When to read:** See [references/user-permissions.md](references/user-permissions.md) when implementing document-level restrictions using User Permissions with comprehensive examples for multi-company, territory, and department-based access.

## Share Permissions

Documents can be explicitly shared with specific users:

```python
frappe.share.add(
    doctype="Sales Order",
    name="SO-0001",
    user="user@example.com",
    read=1,
    write=1,
    share=0,
    submit=0,
    notify=1
)
```

**When to read:** See [references/share-permissions.md](references/share-permissions.md) when implementing explicit document sharing between users with examples for collaboration, temporary access, and cross-department workflows.

## Permission Levels

Permission levels provide field-level access control:

- Each field can have a permlevel (0, 1, 2, etc.)
- Users must have role permission with that permlevel to see/edit the field
- Permlevel 0 is default and always checked

**When to read:** See [references/permission-levels.md](references/permission-levels.md) when implementing field-level access control with examples for hiding pricing, cost fields, and internal notes from specific roles.

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Always Escape User Input**: Use `frappe.db.escape()` when building SQL conditions
2. **Fail Secure**: Default to denying access when in doubt
3. **Validate Hook Returns**: Ensure hooks return expected types
4. **Test Permission Boundaries**: Test with users having minimal permissions
5. **Avoid Side Effects**: Permission checks should be read-only

### Performance

1. **Optimize SQL Conditions**: Use indexed columns in WHERE clauses
2. **Cache User Data**: Cache frequently accessed user properties
3. **Minimize Hook Complexity**: Keep permission logic simple and fast
4. **Use Appropriate Hooks**:
   - Use `permission_query_conditions` for list filtering
   - Use `has_permission` for complex document-specific logic

### Maintainability

1. **Document Permission Logic**: Add docstrings explaining the rules
2. **Separate Concerns**: Keep permission logic separate from business logic
3. **Use Constants**: Define permission-related constants
4. **Consistent Return Values**: Be explicit about what you're returning

**When to read:** See [references/best-practices.md](references/best-practices.md) when writing production-ready permission code with comprehensive guidelines for security, performance, and maintainability.

## Debugging Permissions

### Enable Debug Mode

```python
# In Python
result = frappe.has_permission("DocType", "read", doc, debug=True)
# Logs will show the permission evaluation flow

# Or enable globally
frappe.conf.developer_mode = 1
```

### Check Permission Debug Logs

```python
# After permission check with debug=True
logs = frappe.local.permission_debug_log
for log in logs:
    print(log)
```

**When to read:** See [references/debugging.md](references/debugging.md) when troubleshooting permission issues with comprehensive debugging workflows, common scenarios, and logging techniques.

## Common Issues and Solutions

## Core Implementation Files

Key files in Frappe codebase:
- `/frappe/permissions.py` - Main permission system
- `/frappe/model/db_query.py` - Permission query integration
- `/frappe/model/document.py` - Document lifecycle and permission checks
- `/frappe/core/doctype/user_permission/` - User permission management

## Usage

When working with permissions:

1. **Identify the requirement**: What access control is needed?
2. **Choose appropriate hook**: Select based on use case
3. **Reference appropriate guide**: Use reference files for detailed patterns
4. **Follow best practices**: Security, performance, maintainability
5. **Test thoroughly**: With different roles and edge cases
6. **Debug when needed**: Use debug mode and logging

## Important Notes

- Administrator always bypasses all permission checks
- Permission query conditions are applied to both list views AND individual document access
- Virtual doctypes don't support permission query conditions
- Child tables inherit parent document permissions
- Always escape user input in SQL conditions to prevent SQL injection
- Permission checks should be read-only operations
