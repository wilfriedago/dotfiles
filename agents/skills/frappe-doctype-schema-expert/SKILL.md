# DocType Schema Expert

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for working with Frappe DocType schemas, their JSON structure, field definitions, and best practices.

## Overview

DocTypes are the fundamental building blocks of a Frappe application. Each DocType defines:

- **Database Table Structure**: Fields and their types
- **UI Form Layout**: How data is displayed and edited
- **Business Logic**: Controllers and validation rules
- **Permissions**: Who can access and modify data

Every DocType is defined by a JSON file (e.g., `doctype_name.json`) that specifies the complete schema.

**Note**: Custom DocTypes created via the UI do not have a .json file on disk. Their definition is stored in the database only. Standard DocTypes (shipped with apps) have JSON files in the codebase.

## Quick Reference

### Core DocType Properties

Essential properties that define a DocType's behavior:

- **doctype**: Always "DocType"
- **name**: The DocType name (e.g., "Sales Order")
- **module**: Module this DocType belongs to
- **istable**: Set to 1 for child tables (used in Table fields)
- **issingle**: Set to 1 for single doctypes (no table, one instance only)
- **is_submittable**: Set to 1 to enable Submit/Cancel workflow
- **is_tree**: Set to 1 for hierarchical/tree structures
- **editable_grid**: Set to 1 for inline editing in child tables
- **custom**: Set to 1 for custom doctypes
- **fields**: Array of field definitions
- **permissions**: Array of permission definitions

### Field Types Categories

**Data Fields** (store values):
- Text: `Data`, `Text`, `Small Text`, `Long Text`, `Code`, `Text Editor`, `HTML Editor`, `Markdown Editor`
- Numeric: `Int`, `Long Int`, `Float`, `Currency`, `Percent`
- Date/Time: `Date`, `Datetime`, `Time`, `Duration`
- Special: `Link`, `Dynamic Link`, `Select`, `Check`, `Attach`, `Attach Image`, `JSON`, `Password`, `Color`, `Barcode`, `Geolocation`, `Rating`, `Signature`, `Phone`, `Autocomplete`, `Icon`, `Read Only`

**Layout Fields** (UI structure only):
- `Section Break`, `Column Break`, `Tab Break`, `HTML`, `Button`, `Image`, `Fold`, `Heading`

**Relationship Fields**:
- `Table`: Child table (one-to-many)
- `Table MultiSelect`: Multiple selection from child table
- `Link`: Foreign key to another DocType
- `Dynamic Link`: Foreign key determined by another field

## Common Tasks

### Creating a New DocType

1. Create JSON file: `frappe/module_name/doctype/doctype_name/doctype_name.json`
2. Define basic structure with required properties
3. Add fields in the `fields` array
4. Define permissions in the `permissions` array
5. Run `bench migrate` to create database table

See [references/doctype-structure.md](references/doctype-structure.md) for complete structure.

### Adding Fields

Add field objects to the `fields` array with these essential properties:

```json
{
  "fieldname": "field_name",
  "fieldtype": "Data",
  "label": "Field Label",
  "reqd": 0,
  "hidden": 0,
  "read_only": 0
}
```

See [references/field-types.md](references/field-types.md) for all field types and their properties.

### Child Tables

Child tables require:

1. Parent DocType: Field with `fieldtype: "Table"` and `options` pointing to child DocType
2. Child DocType: Set `istable: 1` and include parent tracking fields

The framework automatically adds `parent`, `parenttype`, and `parentfield` fields to child tables.

### Single DocTypes

Single doctypes (settings, configurations) have only one instance:

- Set `issingle: 1`
- Data stored in `tabSingles` table, not a dedicated table
- No `name` field needed (automatically set to DocType name)
- Cannot be renamed or have multiple instances

- **[references/field-types.md](references/field-types.md)**: All field types with descriptions and use cases
- **[references/field-properties.md](references/field-properties.md)**: All field properties and their effects

### Best Practices

- **[references/best-practices.md](references/best-practices.md)**: Schema design patterns and recommendations

### Common Patterns
- **[references/common-patterns.md](references/common-patterns.md)**: Frequently used DocType patterns and configurations

## Key Principles

1. **Naming**: Use PascalCase for DocType names, snake_case for fieldnames
2. **Required Fields**: Mark mandatory fields with `reqd: 1`
3. **Field Order**: Use `field_order` array to control field sequence
4. **Layout**: Use Section/Column Breaks for organized forms
5. **Validation**: Set properties like `unique`, `non_negative`, `precision` for data integrity
6. **Performance**: Add `search_index: 1` to frequently queried fields
7. **User Experience**: Use appropriate field types and provide helpful labels/descriptions

## Standard Fields

Every DocType automatically includes these fields (don't add manually):

- `name`: Unique identifier
- `owner`: User who created the document
- `creation`: Creation timestamp
- `modified`: Last modification timestamp
- `modified_by`: User who last modified
- `docstatus`: Document status (0=Draft, 1=Submitted, 2=Cancelled)
- `idx`: Index for sorting

Optional fields (added automatically when used):
- `_user_tags`: User tags
- `_comments`: Comments
- `_assign`: Assigned users
- `_liked_by`: Users who liked
- `_seen`: Users who viewed

## Usage

When working with DocType schemas:

1. **Identify the task**: Creating new DocType, modifying existing, adding fields, etc.
2. **Reference appropriate guide**: Use reference files for detailed information
3. **Follow conventions**: Adhere to naming and structure guidelines
4. **Validate schema**: Ensure all required properties are present
5. **Test changes**: Run migrations and verify functionality

## Important Notes

- JSON files must be valid JSON (use double quotes, no trailing commas)
- Changes to DocType schema require running `bench migrate`
- Renaming fields or changing field types can cause data loss
- Always backup before making schema changes
- Test schema changes in development before production
- Field names cannot be changed after data exists (requires migration)
